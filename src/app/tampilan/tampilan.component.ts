Please note that your pick-up time will be between ${row.PickupTime} - ${pickupTimeUpdated} AM at ${row.Location}. The driver will assist you with the check in process in Bali harbor. Please be informed that this is a group tour, and on rare occasions, some participants may not be punctual. However, rest assured that we will inform you in case of any delays when picking you up. Please don't worry, as you will still be picked up as scheduled

For tomorrow we are scheduled to depart at 07:30 AM from Sanur port. When you arrive in Nusa Penida, please be attentive and look for our team holding a white paper sign with your name on it. Your tour will be arranged by our team from this point onwards.

Approximately 20% of the roads in Nusa Penida are still bumpy, and public facilities are limited. Due to the narrow roads, we may encounter some traffic jams while moving from one spot to another.

Additionally, please bring some extra cash for restroom usage and lunch. The local restaurants offer a variety of food options, including Indonesian, Western, and Chinese cuisine.

Upon your return to Sanur Harbor around 5:45- 6:00 PM, please make your way back to the ticket pick-up point. Your driver will be waiting there, ready to transport you back to your hotel.
